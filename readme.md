The Titanic project consists of a locally executed training step from which the resulting model is uploaded to Hopsworks along with the dataset. This dataset was collected from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic with some changes being made to it, these include dropping the columns for which we did not expect a strong correlation with survivability (name, SibSp (sibling or spouse), ticket number, fare (as this would already be correlated with the class)) and cabin as this had 78% null entries. Furthermore, sex was converted to a numerical value by mapping female to 0 and male to 1, and rows with null values were removed. This data cleaning was performed in Excel as then exported as a csv. 
When a user wants to interact with the model, they can do so by going to https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhruvshettty/titanic-inference and enter the information of a (fictional) passenger to see the model's prediction for their survival. This will send a call to Hopsworks to run the model.
To analyse the performance of the model, one could go to https://huggingface.co/spaces/dhruvshettty/titanic-inference-monitor to see the confusion matrix, which displays the classification results for previous calls to the model.
