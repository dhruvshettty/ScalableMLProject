pass: train and run the model, register it as a model on hugging face, move gradio part to a hugging face space
better: explain how to improve the model (and run experiments), break up the notebook into a feature, training and UI pipeline, do something interesting


tips/notes: 
use checkpoints for training
feature engineering takes about 45m and does not use the GPU
training time about 6 hours on colab
Uses about 20gb of storage
